## Course Structure

This repository contains 4 progressive lessons plus a practical project:

### Lesson 1: Swift Fundamentals
- Printing to console
- Variables vs Constants (`var` vs `let`)
- Data types (String, Int, Double)
- Basic arithmetic operations
- String interpolation
- Introduction to building a mini game

### Lesson 2: Logic & Control Flow
- Boolean values and logic
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `else if`)
- Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
- Real-world examples with practical scenarios

### Lesson 3: Collections & Functions
- Arrays (creating, accessing, and modifying)
- Array methods (`.append()`, `.remove()`, `.count`)
- Loops (`for...in`, range loops)
- Loop indexing
- Functions (defining and calling)
- Function parameters

### Lesson 4: SwiftUI Basics
- Introduction to SwiftUI
- Creating views
- Text styling and modifiers
- Layout with VStack and HStack
- Interactive elements with `@State`
- Building user interfaces

### Soundboard Project
A complete SwiftUI iOS app that demonstrates:
- SwiftUI app structure
- Audio playback with AVFoundation
- Grid layouts
- Data modeling with `Identifiable`
- Resource management
- Interactive buttons

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- macOS computer
- Xcode 14.0 or later
- Basic understanding of using a code editor

### Running the Lessons

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd swift-lessons
   ```

2. **For Swift files (Lesson 1-3)**
   - Open any lesson file in Xcode
   - Use the Swift Playgrounds or create a new Swift file
   - Run the code to see the output in the console

3. **For SwiftUI projects (Lesson 4 & Soundboard)**
   - Create a new iOS App project in Xcode
   - Replace the ContentView.swift with the lesson code
   - Run in the iOS Simulator

### Soundboard Project Setup
For the soundboard app, you'll need to add audio files to your project:
- Required files: `dog.mp3`, `cat.mp3`, `lion.mp3`, `car.mp3`, `firetruck.mp3`, `elephant.mp3`, `piano.mp3`, `drums.mp3`, `pizza.mp3`
- Add these files to your Xcode project's Resources folder

## Learning Path

Follow the lessons in order:
1. Start with `lesson1.swift` to learn Swift basics
2. Progress through `lesson2.swift` for control flow
3. Master collections and functions in `lesson3.swift`
4. Learn SwiftUI fundamentals in `lesson4.swift`
5. Build the complete Soundboard app to apply everything you've learned

## Tips for Success

- Type out the code yourself rather than copying - this builds muscle memory
- Experiment by changing values and seeing what happens
- Run the code frequently to understand how changes affect output
- Don't worry about making mistakes - that's how we learn!
- Add comments to explain your understanding

## What You'll Learn

By completing these lessons, you'll be able to:
-  Write Swift code with proper syntax
-  Understand and use variables, constants, and data types
-  Create conditional logic and loops
-  Work with arrays and functions
-  Build interactive iOS apps with SwiftUI
-  Handle user input and state management
-  Play audio in iOS applications

## Notes

Each lesson includes:
- Clear comments explaining concepts
- Practical examples
- Real-world scenarios
- Emojis for visual engagement

# Swift Lessons

A comprehensive Swift programming course covering fundamental language concepts and iOS app development with SwiftUI.

## Overview

This course provides a structured learning path from basic Swift syntax through intermediate iOS development using modern SwiftUI frameworks. Each lesson builds upon previous concepts with hands-on examples and practical applications.

## Course Structure

This repository contains 4 progressive lessons plus a practical project:

### Lesson 1: Swift Fundamentals
- Printing to console
- Variables vs Constants (`var` vs `let`)
- Data types (String, Int, Double)
- Basic arithmetic operations
- String interpolation
- Introduction to building a mini game

### Lesson 2: Logic & Control Flow
- Boolean values and logic
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `else if`)
- Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
- Real-world examples with practical scenarios

### Lesson 3: Collections & Functions
- Arrays (creating, accessing, and modifying)
- Array methods (`.append()`, `.remove()`, `.count`)
- Loops (`for...in`, range loops)
- Loop indexing
- Functions (defining and calling)
- Function parameters

### Lesson 4: SwiftUI Basics
- Introduction to SwiftUI
- Creating views
- Text styling and modifiers
- Layout with VStack and HStack
- Interactive elements with `@State`
- Building user interfaces

### Soundboard Project
A complete SwiftUI iOS app that demonstrates:
- SwiftUI app structure
- Audio playback with AVFoundation
- Grid layouts
- Data modeling with `Identifiable`
- Resource management
- Interactive buttons

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- macOS computer
- Xcode 14.0 or later
- Basic understanding of using a code editor

### Setup and Execution

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd swift-lessons
   ```

2. **Lessons 1-3 (Swift Language Fundamentals)**

   **Using Swift Playgrounds (Recommended)**
   - Open Swift Playgrounds on macOS
   - Create a new blank playground
   - Copy the lesson code into the playground editor
   - Run the code with Cmd+Enter to see real-time output
   - Output appears in the results panel on the right side
   - Modify code and run again to experiment with different values

   **Alternative: Using a text editor and Swift REPL**
   - Open any lesson file in a text editor
   - Copy the code into a Swift REPL session in Terminal
   - See immediate feedback as you execute each line

3. **Lessons 4 and Soundboard Project (SwiftUI)**
   - These lessons require an iOS development environment
   - Set up an iOS app project with SwiftUI
   - Copy lesson code into the app's view file
   - Run on iOS Simulator to test UI and interactions

### Soundboard Project Configuration

The soundboard application requires audio resources:
- Audio files: `dog.mp3`, `cat.mp3`, `lion.mp3`, `car.mp3`, `firetruck.mp3`, `elephant.mp3`, `piano.mp3`, `drums.mp3`, `pizza.mp3`
- Add files to the Xcode project's Resources folder
- Ensure files are added to the application target

## Recommended Sequence

Complete lessons in the following order to build upon foundational concepts:
1. `lesson1.swift` - Swift language fundamentals and syntax
2. `lesson2.swift` - Conditional statements and logical operations
3. `lesson3.swift` - Data structures, iteration, and functions
4. `lesson4.swift` - SwiftUI framework and user interface development
5. Soundboard Project - Integrated application development with audio playback

## Best Practices

- Type code manually rather than copying to build familiarity
- Modify values and observe output to understand behavior
- Execute code frequently during learning
- Use comments to document key concepts and logic
- Review error messages to understand language behavior

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, you will be able to:
- Write and execute Swift code with proper syntax
- Use variables, constants, and fundamental data types
- Implement conditional logic and iterative control flow
- Create and manipulate arrays and function definitions
- Develop interactive iOS applications using SwiftUI
- Manage application state and user interaction
- Integrate audio playback in iOS applications

## Lesson Format

Each lesson includes:
- Inline comments explaining concepts and syntax
- Practical code examples with varying complexity
- Real-world use cases and applications
- Runnable code that produces immediate output
